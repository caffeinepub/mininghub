# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure the MiningHub PDF includes a crypto mining explainer section describing what crypto mining is and how it works.

**Planned changes:**
- Verify the existing implemented crypto mining explainer section is included in the generated MiningHub PDF output (no duplicate section).
- Update the PDF generation flow/template to place the existing section in the correct location in the PDF, if it is currently missing or not rendered.

**User-visible outcome:** The exported MiningHub PDF contains the crypto mining explainer content (already in Hindi) explaining what crypto mining is and how it works.
